    <p>The term “full-stack” refers to all of the technologies and skills that are needed to finish a project. Each of these is called a “stack.” To put it another way, stacks can be made for mobile, the Web, or software. Plenty of the time, a software engineer works on either the front end or back end. In other words, the full stack is a set of frameworks, libraries, and tools for both client and server software that help make an application or website work well.
